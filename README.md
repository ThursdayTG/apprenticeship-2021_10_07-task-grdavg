Another problem we were tasked to solve, and the first one where I didn't use Visual Studio.

Quite honestly, I quickly learnt to hate Visual Studio - and the Windows system configured by the vocational school - during this apprenticeship. Fortunately for me, though, I already made some experiences with Linux systems. So I started bringing Linux systems with KDE Plasma to vocational school and now use Kate and the GCC C++ compiler.
