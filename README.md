This is the second problem we were tasked to solve in our apprenticeship, and it was the first day in which we've been thrown right into it without any introductions or anything. I like such days in this apprenticeship the most, however, as of 2021, these days are rather rare.

This was also the first day where I have not used Visual Studio in this apprenticeship. I had quickly learnt to dislike both Visual Studio and the Windows system as it was configured by my vocational school, so I started bringing my own Linux system to school and now use Kate and the GCC C++ compiler (hence the comment at the bottom of the .cpp file).

We did not learn about loops until quite a bit later, version charlie is something I had done in my free time for educational purposes.
